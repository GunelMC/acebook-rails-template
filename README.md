Then:

> bundle install
> bin/rails db:create

> bundle exec rspec # Run the tests to ensure it works
> bin/rails server # Start the server at localhost:3000

## Troubleshooting

If you don't have Node.js installed yet, you might run into this error when running rspec:
```
ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable:
  Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See https://github.com/rails/execjs for a list of available runtimes.
 ```
That is because Rails will use a Javascript runtime (such as Node) under the hood. The easiest way is to install Node by running `brew install node` - 
and then run `bundle exec rspec` again
